      <h1>We Also Believe</h1>
      <h3>Life, Marriage, and Sexuality</h3>
      <p>
        We believe in the sanctity of life and that each human being has a soul
        and spirit that will live beyond the human experience. We believe that
        every human life was created by God at conception and is intended to
        flourish and give glory to Him regardless of the gender, circumstances
        surrounding conception, or any mental or physical prognosis or
        condition. Life is a gift from God and must be cherished, defended, and
        protected from conception until natural death. We believe that the
        direct taking of an innocent human life for any reason is a moral evil,
        regardless of intention. Because we are created in God’s own image, we
        believe in caring for the pre-born, the aged, the poor, the handicapped,
        the homeless, the orphan, and the widow without partiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        God is the author and creator of marriage and sexuality. His Word
        declares the sacred union of one man and one woman (as their physical
        genders were determined at birth) in marriage is designed to be
        monogamous for a lifetime. The Bible clearly states that any other form
        of inordinate affection is a sin. Therefore, homosexuality, lesbianism,
        bestiality, polygamy, pedophilia, fornication, adultery, or any other
        sexual acts outside the bonds of marriage is considered sinful. (Genesis
        1-3, Psalm 139, Matthew 5:31-32; Matthew 19:4-6; Mark 10:2-12; Romans
        1:18-32, 2 Peter 2)
      </p>

      <h3>ORDINANCES.</h3>
      <p>
        We observe two ordinances of our Lord Jesus Christ: Baptism (Mat.28:19)
        and The Lord’s Supper (1Cor.11:23-26). We also believe in the dedication
        of children to the Lord by believing parents (Eph.6:4).

      <h3>Regeneration</h3>
      <p>
        Regeneration is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit by which a new
        nature and eternal life are given (John 3:3-7; Titus 3:5). It is
        instantaneous and is accomplished solely by the power of the Holy Spirit
        through the instrumentality of the Word of God (John 5:24) when the
        repentant sinner, as enabled by the Holy Spirit, responds in faith to
        the divine provision of salvation. Genuine regeneration is manifested by
        fruits worthy of repentance as demonstrated in righteous attitudes and
        conduct. Good works will be its proper evidence and fruit (1 Corinthians
        6:19-20; Ephesians 2:10) and will be experienced to the extent that the
        believer submits to the control of the Holy Spirit in his life through
        faithful obedience to the Word of God (Ephesians 5:17-21; Philippians
        2:12b; Colossians 3:16; 2 Peter 1:4-10). This obedience causes the
        believer to be increasingly conformed to the image of our Lord Jesus
        Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). Such a conformity is climaxed in the
        believer’s glorification at Christ’s coming (Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4; 1
        John 3:2 3).
      </p>
      <h3>Election</h3>

      <p>
        Election is the act of God by which, before the foundation of the world,
        He chose in Christ those whom He graciously regenerates, saves, and
        sanctifies (Romans 8:28-30; Ephesians 1:4-11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2
        Timothy 2:10; 1 Peter 1:1-2). Sovereign election does not contradict or
        negate the responsibility of man to repent and trust Christ as Savior
        and Lord (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11; John 3:18-19, 36; 5:40; Romans
        9:22-23; 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12; Revelation 22:17). Nevertheless, since
        sovereign grace includes the means of receiving the gift of salvation as
        well as the gift itself, sovereign election will result in what God
        determines. All whom the Father calls to Himself will come in faith, and
        all who come in faith the Father will receive (John 6:37-40, 44; Acts
        13:48; James 4:8). The unmerited favor that God grants to totally
        depraved sinners is neither related to any initiative of their own part
        nor to God’s anticipation of what they might do by their own will, but
        is solely of His sovereign grace and mercy (Ephesians 1:4-7; Titus
        3:4-7; 1 Peter 1:2). Election should not be looked upon as based merely
        on abstract sovereignty. God is truly sovereign, but He exercises this
        sovereignty in harmony with His other attributes, especially His
        omniscience, justice, holiness, wisdom, grace, and love (Romans
        9:11-16). This sovereignty will always exalt the will of God in a manner
        totally consistent with His character as revealed in the life of our
        Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 11:25-28; 2 Timothy 1:9).
      </p>

      <h3>Justification</h3>

      <p>
        Justification before God is an act of God (Romans 8:33) by which He
        legally declares righteous those who, through faith in Christ, repent of
        their sins (Luke 13:3; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 11:18; Romans 2:4; 2 Corinthians
        7:10; Isaiah 55:6-7) and confess Him as sovereign Lord (Romans 10:9-10;
        1 Corinthians 12:3; 2 Corinthians 4:5; Philippians 2:11). This
        righteousness is apart from any virtue or work of man (Romans 3:20; 4:6)
        and involves the imputation of our sins to Christ (Colossians 2:14; 1
        Peter 2:24) and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to us (1
        Corinthians 1:30; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Hence, God is both “just and the
        justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus” (Romans 3:26).
      </p>

      <h3>Sanctification</h3>

      <p>
        Every believer is sanctified (set apart) unto God by justification and
        is, therefore, declared to be holy and is, therefore, identified as a
        saint. Sanctification is positional and instantaneous and should not be
        confused with progressive sanctification. Sanctification has to do with
        the believer’s standing, not his present walk or condition (Acts 20:32;
        1 Corinthians 1:2, 30; 6:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews 2:11; 3:1;
        10:10, 14; 13:12; 1 Peter 1:2). There is also, by the work of the Holy
        Spirit, a progressive sanctification by which the state of the believer
        is brought closer to the standing the believer positionally enjoys
        through justification. Through obedience to the Word of God and by the
        empowerment of the Holy Spirit, the believer is able to live a life of
        increasing holiness in conformity to the will of God, becoming more and
        more like our Lord Jesus Christ (John 17:17, 19; Romans 6:1-22; 2
        Corinthians 3:18; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-4; 5:23). In this respect, every
        saved person is involved in a daily conflict, the new creation in Christ
        doing battle against the flesh, but adequate provision is made for
        victory through the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit. This struggle
        nevertheless stays with the believer and is never completely ended
        throughout this earthly life. All claims to the eradication of sin in
        this life are unscriptural. Eradication of sin is not possible, but the
        Holy Spirit does provide for victory over sin (Galatians 5:16-25;
        Ephesians 4:22-24; Philippians 3:12; Colossians 3:9-10; 1 Peter 1:14-16;
        1 John 3:5-9).
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>

      <p>
        All the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s power and are thus
        secure in Christ forever (John 5:24; 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Romans 5:9-10;
        8:1, 31-39; 1 Corinthians 1:4-8; Ephesians 4:30; Hebrews 7:25; 13:5; 1
        Peter 1:5; Jude 24). It is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the
        assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word, which,
        however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion for
        sinful living and carnality (Romans 6:15-22; 13:13-14; Galatians 5:13,
        25-26; Titus 2:11-14).
      </p>

      <h3>Separation</h3>

      <p>
        Separation from sin is clearly called for throughout the Old and New
        Testaments, and the Scriptures clearly indicate that in the last days,
        apostasy and worldliness shall increase (2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 2
        Timothy 3:1-5). Out of deep gratitude for the undeserved grace of God
        granted to us and because our glorious God is so worthy of our total
        consecration, all believers should live in such a manner as to
        demonstrate their adoring love to God and so as not to bring reproach
        upon our Lord and Savior. Separation from all religious apostasy and
        worldly, sinful practices is commanded of us by God (Romans 12:1-2, 1
        Corinthians 5:9-13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 1 John 2:15-17; 2 John
        9-11). Believers should be separated unto the Lord Jesus Christ (2
        Thessalonians 1:11-12; Hebrews 12:1-2) and affirm that the Christian
        life is a life of obedient righteousness that reflects the teaching of
        the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:2-12) and a continual pursuit of holiness
        (Romans 12:1-2; 2 Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 12:14; Titus 2:11-14; 1 John
        3:1-10).

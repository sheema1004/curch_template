      <h1>The Trinity</h1>
      <img src="./images/trinity_image.jpg" alt="trinity_page_img" />

      <h3>God the Father</h3>
      <p>
        God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all
        things according to His own purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8-9; 1
        Corinthians 8:6). He is the Creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31;
        Ephesians 3:9). As the only absolute and omnipotent Ruler in the
        universe, He is sovereign in creation, providence, and redemption (Psalm
        103:19; Romans 11:36). His Fatherhood involves both His designations
        within the Trinity and His relationship with mankind. As Creator He is
        Father to all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is spiritual Father only to
        believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18). He has an all-inclusive
        plan that He designed for His own glory in all things that come to pass
        (Ephesians 1:11). He continually upholds, directs, and governs all
        creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His sovereignty He is
        neither author nor approver of sin (Habakkuk 1:13; John 8:38-47), nor
        does He abridge the accountability of moral, intelligent creatures (1
        Peter 1:17). He has graciously chosen from eternity past those whom He
        would have as His own (Ephesians 1:4 6); He saves from sin all who come
        to Him through Jesus Christ; He adopts as His own all those who come to
        Him; and He becomes, upon adoption, Father to His own (John 1:12; Romans
        8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews 12:5-9).
      </p>

      <h3>God the Son</h3>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ, the second Person of the Trinity, possesses all the divine
        excellencies, and in these He is coequal, consubstantial, and coeternal
        with the Father (John 10:30; 14:9). God the Father created according to
        His own will, through His Son, Jesus Christ, by whom all things continue
        in existence and in operation (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17; Hebrews
        1:2).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the incarnation (God becoming man), Christ surrendered only the
        prerogatives of deity but nothing of the divine essence, either in
        degree or kind. In His incarnation, the eternally existing second Person
        of the Trinity accepted all the essential characteristics of humanity
        and so became the God-Man (Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 2:9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ represents humanity and deity in indivisible oneness (Micah
        5:2; John 5:23; 14:9-10; Colossians 2:9).
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ is virgin-born (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23,25; Luke
        1:26-35); He is God incarnate (John 1:1,14); and the purpose of the
        incarnation was to reveal God, redeem men, and rule over God’s kingdom
        (Psalm 2:7-9; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:29; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews
        7:25-26; 1 Peter 1:18,19).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity laid aside His
        right to the full prerogatives of coexistence with God, assumed the
        place of a Son, and took on an existence appropriate to a servant while
        never divesting Himself of His divine attributes (Philippians 2:5-8).
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through the shedding of His
        blood and sacrificial death on the cross. His death was voluntary,
        vicarious, substitutionary, propitiatory, and redemptive (John 10:15;
        Romans 3:24-25; 5:8; 1 Peter 2:24).
      </p>
      <p>
        On the basis of the efficacy of the death of Jesus Christ, the believing
        sinner is freed from the punishment, the penalty, the power, and one day
        the very presence of sin, and he is declared righteous, given eternal
        life, and adopted into the family of God (Romans 3:25; 5:8-9; 2
        Corinthians 5:14-15; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18).
      </p>

      <p>
        Our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection
        from the dead and that He is now ascended to the right hand of the
        Father, where He now mediates as our Advocate and High Priest (Matthew
        28:6; Luke 24:38-39; Acts 2:30-31; Romans 4:25; 8:34; Hebrews 7:25;
        9:24; 1 John 2:1).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave, God confirmed the
        deity of His Son and gave proof that God has accepted the atoning work
        of Christ on the cross. Jesus’ bodily resurrection is also the guarantee
        of a future resurrection life for all believers (John 5:26-29; 14:19;
        Romans 1:4; 4:25; 6:5-10; 1 Corinthians 15:20, 23).
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus Christ will return to receive the church, which is called His
        Body, unto Himself at the rapture, and returning with His church in
        glory, will establish His millennial kingdom on earth (Acts 1:9-11; 1
        Thessalonians 4:13-18; Revelation 20).
      </p>

      <p>
        Jesus Christ is the One through whom God will judge all mankind (John
        5:22-23): a) Believers (1 Corinthians 3:10-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10) b)
        Living inhabitants of the earth at His glorious return (Matthew
        25:31-46) c) Unbelieving dead at the Great White Throne (Revelation
        20:11-15)
      </p>

      <p>
        As the Mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5), the Head of His
        Body the church (Ephesians 1:22; 5:23; Colossians 1:18), and the coming
        universal King, who will reign on the throne of David (Isaiah 9:6; Luke
        1:31-33), He is the final Judge of all who fail to place their trust in
        Him as Lord and Savior (Matthew 25:14-46; Acts 17:30-31).
      </p>

      <h3>God the Holy Spirit</h3>
      <p>
        The Holy Spirit is a divine Person, eternal, underived, possessing all
        the attributes of personality and deity including intellect (1
        Corinthians 2:10-13), emotions (Ephesians 4:30), will (1 Corinthians
        12:11), eternality (Hebrews 9:14), omnipresence (Psalm 139:7-10),
        omniscience (Isaiah 40:13-14), omnipotence (Romans 15:13), and
        truthfulness (John 16:13). In all the divine attributes He is coequal
        and consubstantial with the Father and the Son (Matthew 28:19; Acts
        5:3-4; 28:25-26; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; and Jeremiah
        31:31-34 with Hebrews 10:15-17).
      </p>

      <p>
        The work of the Holy Spirit is to execute the divine will with relation
        to all mankind. His activity is sovereign in creation (Genesis 1:2), the
        incarnation (Matthew 1:18), the written revelation (2 Peter 1:20 21),
        and the work of salvation (John 3:5-7).
      </p>

      <p>
        The work of the Holy Spirit in this age began at Pentecost when He came
        from the Father as promised by Christ (John 14:16-17; 15:26) to initiate
        and complete the building of the Body of Christ, which is His church (1
        Corinthians 12:13). The broad scope of His divine activity includes
        convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment;
        glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ; and transforming believers into the
        image of Christ (John 16:7-9; Acts 1:5; 2:4; Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians
        3:18; Ephesians 2:22).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Holy Spirit is the supernatural and sovereign Agent in regeneration,
        baptizing all believers into the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13).
        The Holy Spirit also indwells, sanctifies, instructs, empowers believers
        for service, and seals them unto the day of redemption (Romans 8:9; 2
        Corinthians 3:6; Ephesians 1:13).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Holy Spirit is the divine Teacher, who guided the apostles and
        prophets into all truth as they committed to writing God’s revelation,
        the Bible. Every believer possesses the indwelling presence of the Holy
        Spirit from the moment of salvation, and it is the duty of all those
        born of the Spirit to be filled with (controlled by) the Spirit (John
        16:13; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 5:18; 2 Peter 1:19-21; 1 John 2:20, 27).
      </p>

      <p>
        The Holy Spirit administers spiritual gifts to the church. The Holy
        Spirit glorifies neither Himself nor His gifts by ostentatious displays,
        but He does glorify Christ by implementing His work of redeeming the
        lost and building up believers in the holiest faith (John 16:13-14; Acts
        1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 3:18).
      </p>

      <p>
        God the Holy Spirit is sovereign in the bestowing of all His gifts for
        the perfecting of the saints today. Speaking in tongues and the working
        of sign miracles in the beginning days of the church were for the
        purpose of pointing to and authenticating the apostles as revealers of
        divine truth and were never intended to be characteristic of the lives
        of believers (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 13:8-10; 2 Corinthians 12:12;
        Ephesians 4:7-12; Hebrews 2:1-4).

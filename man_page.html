      <h1>Man</h1>
      <img src="./images/man_image.jpeg" alt="Man_page_img" />
      <p>
        Man was directly and immediately created by God on the sixth day of
        creation. He was created in God’s image and likeness and with the
        appearance of age. Man was created free of sin with a rational nature,
        intelligence, volition, self-determination, and moral responsibility to
        God (Genesis 2:7, 15 25; James 3:9). Men are distinct from angels in
        that they are a race while angels are not. Therefore, men cannot become
        angels, and angels cannot become men. Men are distinct from both angels
        and God and will be for all eternity (1 Corinthians 6:3; Hebrews 1:14;
        2:6-8; 12:22-24). Men are similar to angels in having a personality but
        limited more so in power and abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        God’s intention in the creation of man was that man should glorify God,
        enjoy God’s fellowship, live his life in the will of God, and by this
        accomplish God’s purpose for man in the world (Isaiah 43:7; Colossians
        1:16; Revelation 4:11). The sin nature is that reality that has been
        imputed directly from Adam to every individual since Adam (except Jesus
        Christ) (Romans 5:12-19). The whole human race exists seminally through
        Adam as the head. Thus, there is a seminal universality of humanity. The
        nature that each person, with the exception of Christ, possesses is the
        sinful nature passed on from Adam to each generation. By this nature,
        all men are guilty with race guilt through Adam. The sin nature is
        inherited, and each person is guilty at the point of conception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every person has a sin nature and is totally depraved in that they lack
        the proper affection and love toward God and do evil. Total depravity
        also refers to the complete man having been corrupted by sin, including
        man’s will. The inherited sin is the nature of man while the imputed sin
        is the reality of that nature imputed to each person from Adam. Adam and
        Eve are sinners because they sinned. Every person afterward sins because
        he possesses a sin nature. After the fall, Adam and Eve committed sin
        because they then had a sin nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Adam’s sin of disobedience to the revealed will and Word of God, man
        lost his innocence, incurred the penalty of spiritual and physical
        death, became subject to the wrath of God, and became inherently corrupt
        and utterly incapable of choosing or doing that which is acceptable to
        God apart from divine grace. With no recuperative powers to enable him
        to recover himself, man is hopelessly lost. Man’s salvation is thereby
        wholly of God’s grace through the redemptive work of our Lord Jesus
        Christ (Genesis 2:16 17; 3:1-19; John 3:36; Romans 3:23; 6:23; 1
        Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 2:1-3; 1 Timothy 2:13-14; 1 John 1:8).
        Because all men are in Adam, all men of all eras, Jesus Christ being the
        only exception, inherit a nature corrupted by Adam’s sin. All men are
        thus sinners by nature, by choice, and by divine declaration (Psalm
        14:1-3; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 3:9-18, 23; 5:10-12).

      <h3>Abortion</h3>

      <p>
        Abortion is the act of murdering an unborn child. The modern debate on
        the issue of abortion finds its roots in the view of the creation of
        man. Due to evolutionary thinking, the unborn child is called a fetus
        and treated as a parasite. A full propagation view does not allow for
        abortion at any time or in any circumstances. This statement is based on
        the fact that at the point of conception, the unborn child is a full
        human being with a physical body (yet being formed but, nonetheless,
        existing) and a spirit.

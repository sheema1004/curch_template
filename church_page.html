      <h1>The Church</h1>
      <img src="./images/church_image.jpg" alt="church_page_img" />
      <p>
        All who place their faith in Jesus Christ are immediately placed by the
        Holy Spirit into one united spiritual body, called the church (1
        Corinthians 12:12-13), the bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2;
        Ephesians 5:23-32; Revelation 19:7-8), of which Christ is the Head
        (Ephesians 1:22; 4:15; Colossians 1:18). The formation of the church,
        the body of Christ, began on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-21, 38-47)
        and will be completed at the coming of Christ for His own at the rapture
        (1 Corinthians 15:51-52; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).
      </p>

      <p>
        The church is thus a unique spiritual organism designed by Christ, made
        up of all born again believers in this present age (Ephesians 2:11-3:6).
        The church is distinct from Israel (1 Corinthians 10:32), a mystery not
        revealed until this age (Ephesians 3:1-6; 5:32). The establishment and
        continuity of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New
        Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:23, 27; 20:17, 28; Galatians 1:2;
        Philippians 1:1; 1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1) and that the
        members of the one spiritual body are directed to associate themselves
        together in local assemblies (1 Corinthians 11:18-20; Hebrews 10:25).
      </p>

      <p>
        The one supreme authority for the church is Christ (1 Corinthians 11:3;
        Ephesians 1:22; Colossians 1:18), and church leadership, gifts, order,
        discipline, and worship are all appointed through His sovereignty as
        found in the Scriptures. The biblically designated officers serving
        under Christ and over the assembly are elders (also called bishops,
        pastors, and pastor/teachers; Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11) and deacons,
        both of whom must meet biblical qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus
        1:5-9; 1 Peter 5:1-5). These leaders lead or rule as servants of Christ
        (1 Timothy 5:17-22) and have His authority in directing the church. The
        congregation is to submit to their leadership (Hebrews 13:7, 17). The
        Scriptures explain the importance of discipleship (Matthew 28:19-20; 2
        Timothy 2:2), mutual accountability of all believers to each other
        (Matthew 18:5-14), as well as the need for discipline of sinning members
        of the congregation in accordance with the standards of Scripture
        (Matthew 18:15-22; Acts 5:1-11; 1 Corinthians 5:1-13; 2 Thessalonians
        3:6-15; 1 Timothy 1:19-20; Titus 1:10-16).
      </p>

      <p>
        The local church is autonomous, free from any external authority or
        control, with the right of self-government and freedom from the
        interference of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations (Titus
        1:5). It is scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other
        for the presentation and propagation of the faith. Each local c-hurch,
        however, through its elders and their interpretation and application of
        Scripture, should be the sole judge of the measure and method of its
        cooperation. The elders should determine all other matters of
        membership, policy, discipline, benevolence, and government, as well
        (Acts 15:19-31; 20:28; 1 Corinthians 5:4-7, 13; 1 Peter 5:1-4). The
        purpose of the church is to glorify God (Ephesians 3:21) by building
        itself up in the faith (Ephesians 4:13-16), by instruction of the Word
        (2 Timothy 2:2, 15; 3:16-17), by fellowship (Acts 2:47; 1 John 1:3), by
        keeping the ordinances (Luke 22:19; Acts 2:38-42), and by advancing and
        communicating the gospel to the entire world (Matthew 28:19; Acts 1:8;
        2:42). The local church is a God-centered, Bible-centered ministry that
        seeks eternal preparation by the exaltation of God, edification and
        equipping of believers, and evangelization of the world, starting with
        the local community.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Bible teaches the calling of all saints to the work of service (1
        Corinthians 15:58; Ephesians 4:12; Revelation 22:12). The need of the
        church is to cooperate with God as He accomplishes His purpose in the
        world. To that end, He gives the church spiritual gifts. First, He gives
        men chosen for the purpose of equipping the saints for the work of the
        ministry (Ephesians 4:7-12), and He also gives unique and special
        spiritual abilities to each member of the body of Christ (Romans 12:5-8;
        1 Corinthians 12:4-31; 1 Peter 4:10-11). There were two kinds of gifts
        given to the early church. Miraculous gifts of divine revelation and
        healing were given temporarily in the apostolic era for the purpose of
        confirming the authenticity of the apostles’ message (Hebrews 2:3-4; 2
        Corinthians 12:12). Ministering gifts were given to equip believers for
        edifying one another. With the New Testament revelation now complete,
        Scripture becomes the sole test of the authenticity of a man’s message,
        and confirming gifts of a miraculous nature are no longer necessary to
        validate a man or his message (1 Corinthians 13:8-12). Miraculous gifts
        can even be counterfeited by Satan to deceive even believers (1
        Corinthians 13:13-14:12; Revelation 13:13-14). The only gifts in
        operation today are those non-revelatory equipping gifts given for
        edification (Romans 12:6-8). No one possesses the gift of healing today,
        but God does hear and answer the prayer of faith and will answer in
        accordance with His own perfect will for the sick, suffering, and
        afflicted (Luke 18:1-6; John 5:7-9; 2 Corinthians 12:6-10; James
        5:13-16; 1 John 5:14-15).
      </p>

      <p>
        The two ordinances that have been committed to the local church are
        baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:38-42). Christian baptism by
        immersion (Acts 8:36-39) is the solemn and beautiful testimony of a
        believer showing forth his faith in the crucified, buried, and risen
        Savior and his union with Him in death to sin and resurrection to a new
        life (Romans 6:1-11). It is also a sign of fellowship and identification
        with the visible body of Christ (Acts 2:41-42). The Lord’s Supper is the
        commemoration and proclamation of Christ’s death until He comes and
        should be always preceded by solemn self-examination (1 Corinthians
        11:28-32). Whereas the elements of Communion are only representative of
        the flesh and blood of Christ, the Lord’s Supper is nevertheless an
        actual communion with the risen Christ who is present in a unique way,
        fellowshipping with His people (1 Corinthians 10:16).

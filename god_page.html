      <p>
        God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity, orders and disposes all
        things according to His own purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8-9; 1
        Corinthians 8:6). He is the Creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31;
        Ephesians 3:9). As the only absolute and omnipotent Ruler in the
        universe, He is sovereign in creation, providence, and redemption (Psalm
        103:19; Romans 11:36). His Fatherhood involves both His designations
        within the Trinity and His relationship with mankind. As Creator He is
        Father to all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is spiritual Father only to
        believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18). He has an all-inclusive
        plan that He designed for His own glory in all things that come to pass
        (Ephesians 1:11). He continually upholds, directs, and governs all
        creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). In His sovereignty He is
        neither author nor approver of sin (Habakkuk 1:13; John 8:38-47), nor
        does He abridge the accountability of moral, intelligent creatures (1
        Peter 1:17). He has graciously chosen from eternity past those whom He
        would have as His own (Ephesians 1:4 6); He saves from sin all who come
        to Him through Jesus Christ; He adopts as His own all those who come to
        Him; and He becomes, upon adoption, Father to His own (John 1:12; Romans
        8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews 12:5-9).
